# SilverStripe 4.4 changes the way files are resolved. `silverstripe-assets` resolves files using a variety of formats
# by default. When starting a brand new project on SilverStripe 4.4 or greater, those extra formats are not needed and
# will slowdown file resolution requests a bit. This config removes those redundant formats.
